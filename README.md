## 🧬 About Me

I'm a **second-year PhD student** at the *Institute of Medical Sciences*, **University of Aberdeen**, working in the **Murakami Lab** under the supervision of **Dr. Hajime Murakami**.

My research dives into the **molecular mechanisms of meiotic recombination initiation**, specifically how **cohesin** and **chromosome axis proteins** collaborate to orchestrate accurate DNA recombination and chromosome segregation.

🔬 Techniques I use:
- **Advanced ChIP-seq**
- **Molecular Biology Techniques**
- **Bioinformatics** for genome-wide signal analysis
- Scientific storytelling & visualization
